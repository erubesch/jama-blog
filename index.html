      <span class="subheading">The Fate of an Innovator</span>
      <p>Innovation. It is a trendy word these days.</p>
      <p>There are a lot of ways you can approach Innovation. You can invest in it as a venture capitalist, an angel investor, or a company that develops new products.  You can teach it or coach it in a course at a university, online, or in an accelerator. You can encourage and promote it through activities and policies at a government agency.  You can be an influencer, if you are charming and adept and telling good stories, and become famous by telling the world why Elon Musk is successful and why others failed. You can buy innovation as a customer: a new "thing", a new app, a new service, a new experience, a new process, a new ingredient, even some new kind of raw material.</p>
      <p>Or, you can do it.  <strong>That is the big "OR".</strong> </p>
      <p>I remember being at a startup forum in Bangkok many years ago. There was a panel of investors talking about venture investment opportunities and one of them said, "Startup opportunities are like buses, there is always another one coming".</p>
      <p>I was jolted. It became painfully clear: there are lots of important players that make innovation work. All of the people in the above paragraph are important stakeholders in the innovation ecosystem. But none of those players think of a new idea, test it, nurture it, find out if it is worth working on, and develop it to make it work.</p>
      <p>They don't need to. People bring ideas to those people. Those people say yes or no. They choose opportunities, put them together in a portfolio, and manage their risks. For them, there will always be more people bringing them more ideas. There will always be another bus coming.</p>
      <p>I realized at that moment that no matter what others are doing, I want to be driving the bus.</p>
      <p>I don't care how small the bus is, I want to be driving it. I don't care if the bus runs along some route in the middle of nowhere with only a small number of riders (hopefully there are at least some riders, otherwise this analogy breaks down -- lol). I enjoy the challenge of getting the bus up and running and driving it.</p>
      <p>(You can use "low-hanging fruit" instead of "buses." Harvest low-hanging fruit. But, somebody still has to plant the tree. Analogies abound in discussions of innovation and entrepreneurship. Choose your analogy, but the message will be the same: there are lots of stakeholders, but only one kind of person who plants the seed, generates the spark, launches the idea...)</p>   
      <p>Let me manage expectations: I am not talking about the best way to make money. Many people make far more in the stakeholder roles discussed earlier. The guy on stage talking about buses is far more successful than I am based on any financial measure. Most entrepreneurs get successful once and become investors forever after.  For the same reasons, doing something new is also not the best way to get famous. Failure is the norm. It is frustrating. It is not always fun. Innovation is not easy.</p>
      <span class="subheading">Why do it then?</span>
      <p>Building something new gives an incredible feeling of satisfaction, it brings a sense of<i>"flow"</i>--see Dr. Tae. It gives you the confidence that you can confront any situation and know that you can find solutions to make that situation better. And every once in a while, your bus and your route become more and more valuable. More people get on your bus. That feels even better. Yes, getting lucky is part of the life of any innovator.</p>
      <p>My message is for people who want to find their own path, who want to drive their own bus, who want to do something new, or build something new. I offer a gentle nudge to anyone thinking about taking a leap into the unknown, a leap of faith.</p>
      <p>You can leap<i>with</i>faith, with some confidence, and improve your chances of success. You can enjoy the journey even when the destination turns out differently than expected.</p>
       <span class="subheading">How?</span>
       <ul>
        <li>#explore forever</li>
        <li>#experiment fast</li>
        <li>Then #execute</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Let's start at the beginning.</p>
      <p>Building something new starts with<strong>Explore Forever.</strong>Understanding the<i>why</i>before the<i>how</i></p>
      <p>Unless we have unlimited resources, doing something new just to be new, is not enough. Even if we are rich and influential, we want our efforts to be meaningful to somebody else, right? (The rich and influential seem to have an insatiable craving for the opinions of others!) So, when we talk about building something new, we really mean building something new that others believe is better.</p>
